# Story about this homepage

## 0x0 Several Years Ago

I tried to build my own homepage with wordpress years ago, but found it too heavy to use.

## 0x1 Last Year

Last year I heard [Jekyll][jekyll] from [iBug](https://ibug.io), which is a static site generator, and GitHub Pages is suitable for hosting it. I tasted jekyll at once, and felt good. However, I'm a peageon so my homepage was still absent.

## 0x2 This Semester

Thanks to lab 1 in Computer Network this semester, which pushes me to build this homepage XD

Finally I choose [Jekyll][jekyll] + [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) + [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), thanks to [iBug's blog](https://ibug.io/blog/2018/04/build-github-pages-with-travis-ci/). My own domain to be add later=W=

Currently I use [Windows-95](https://github.com/h01000110/windows-95) as my theme. I love such style, but it seems too old ,which means I need to refine it myself or migrate another well maintained one.

~~Well, I will change the font ASAP, the apostrophe disgusts me...~~

Anyway, I've got my homepage. Finally:D
